                    <p>The Nigerian Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) has officially announced the opening of its student loan application portal for the 2025/2026 academic session. This initiative is aimed at providing financial assistance to eligible students in tertiary institutions across the country, ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder their educational pursuits.</p>
                    <p>In a statement released by the fund’s management, the portal is now live and accessible to all students who meet the specified criteria. Prospective applicants are encouraged to visit the official NELFUND website to begin their application process. The statement emphasized the government's commitment to making education accessible to all Nigerian students, regardless of their financial background.</p>
                    <h3>Eligibility and Application Process</h3>
                    <p>To be eligible for the loan, students must be admitted into a recognized public tertiary institution in Nigeria. They will be required to provide their admission letter, a Bank Verification Number (BVN), and a National Identification Number (NIN) as part of the application process. The portal features a user-friendly interface designed to guide applicants through each step seamlessly.</p>
                    <p>The management of Dennis Osadebay University urges all eligible students to take advantage of this opportunity. The university's student affairs division is available to provide guidance and support to students who may face challenges during the application process. This loan scheme represents a significant step towards alleviating the financial burdens on students and their families.</p>
